# About

This is my [eks-anywhere](https://github.com/aws/eks-anywhere) playground wrapped in a vagrant environment.

## Usage

Install the [ubuntu-22.04-amd64](https://github.com/rgl/ubuntu-vagrant) vagrant box.

Launch the environment:

```bash
time vagrant up --provider=libvirt --no-destroy-on-error --no-tty
```
